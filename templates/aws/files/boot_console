# AWS now supports a proper serial console.  Use the serial port for the
# console and allow a short period of time where we can interrupt startup:
#
autoboot_delay="5"
console="ttya"
os_console="ttya"
ttya-mode="115200,8,n,1,-"

#
# AWS have ostensibly screwed up their PIT emulation; insist on the use of our
# somewhat beleaguered HPET support instead:
#
tsc_calibration="HPET"
